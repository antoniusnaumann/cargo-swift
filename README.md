> A cargo plugin to easily build Swift packages from Rust code

*cargo swift* provides interactive commands for initializing and packaging a Rust library as Swift Package for usage in iOS and macOS apps.
This plugin uses Mozilla's [UniFFI](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs) for bridging between Swift and Rust. To learn more about using UniFFI, read its [User Guide](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/latest/),
but note that you can **skip** the parts about generating bindings (section 2.4) and building a swift module (sections 10. and 11.) as *cargo swift* already takes care of this!

## Getting Started
> **Note**
> This plugin can only be used on macOS, since proprietary toolchains are 
> required for this plugin to work properly.

### Prerequisites
Install this plugin, simply run
```
cargo install cargo-swift
```

#### Installing for a different UniFFI version
Currently, `cargo swift` does not detect the UniFFI version of your project automatically, so for now, you have to install a matching version of cargo swift: 
| UniFFI | cargo swift |
|--------|-------------|
| 0.25   | 0.5         |
| 0.26   | 0.6         |
| 0.27   | 0.7         |
| 0.28   | 0.8         |
| 0.29   | 0.9         |

To do so, run 
```
cargo install cargo-swift@0.X -f  
```
and replace `0.X` with the cargo swift version you want to install.

### Using cargo-swift
You can create a new library crate by running
```
cargo swift init
```
This creates a new Rust library crate with some boilerplate code and some examples to quickly get started with UniFFI. For full reference, check out [this chapter of the UniFFI User Guide](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/udl_file_spec.html)

To bundle the previously created Rust library as Swift Package, run:
```
cargo swift package
```
This command interactively prompts you for swift package name, xcframework name, and target platforms.
If some required toolchains for the selected target platforms are missing, cargo swift will ask you if it should install them automatically.

That's it! You can now include the created package in an iOS or macOS app via Swift Package Manager.

### Configuration
As of now, configuration can only be supplied via command line arguments. Most of the time, the default should be fine - however, sometimes it might be useful to store configuration persistently. You can find a draft of how this might look in [CONFIG-DRAFT.md](/CONFIG-DRAFT.md).
